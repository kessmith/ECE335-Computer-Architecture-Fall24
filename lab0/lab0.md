Read the Deliverables carefully at the end of the page.

Lab 0 is graded automatically\ Students
should submit their work early to get feedback and improve their grades if
necessary.

## Learning Objectives

*   Run a RISC-V programs in RARS. 

*   Submit code on Blackboard.

*   Convert non-negative numbers in one radix to another.

*   Take a quiz on Blackboard.

## Description

### Task 1

Follow the instructions on [this page](https://github.com/kessmith/ECE335-Computer-Architecture-Fall24/blob/main/misc/rars.md) to install RARS and run RISC-V programs in RARS. 

Download `lab0.s`. The RARS instructions page mentioned in the previous paragraph has a section about "Download files from GitHub". The page also has a link to more [RISC-V examples.](https://github.com/kessmith/ECE335-Computer-Architecture-Fall24/blob/main/rv-examples).

Modify the `msg` string in lab0.s so the program prints the following. There is
a newline, but no space, after the ending dot.

    Hello, welcome to ECE 335. Here also comes the second spring.

Submit revised `lab0.s` on Blackboard. The submitted filename must be `lab0.s`. It is case sensitive. The system does NOT accept names like `Lab0.s`.

### Task 2

Study the slides in `lab0-numbers.pdf` to learn/review conversion of numbers in
different radices. 

*   Binary to decimal.
*   Decimal to binary.
*   Hexadecimal to decimal.
*   Decimal to hexadecimal.

<!-- Practice on [this page](https://zhijieshi.github.io/cse3666/binarynumbers/).
For now, you can click the Config button and uncheck "Bits are signed". -->

## Deliverables

Submit `lab0.s` on Blackboard and complete Lab0 Quiz. 

The submission pages will be created before the lab sessions.
